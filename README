rmmseg-cpp
==========

rmmseg (http://rmmseg.rubyforge.org) is a Chinese word segmentation library
written for and in Ruby. It features full integration with Ruby. However, 
its performance (both time and memory) is terrible in some cases, especially
when you use the complex algorithm.

So I re-implemented rmmseg in C++ and wrapped it as a Ruby extension. This
gem is aimed at high performance and thus less extensible than the pure-
Ruby rmmseg gem. There are also some differences between them:

 - The dictionary format is different. For performance reason, the words
   dictionary of rmmseg-cpp included the word length information in it. 
   See rdoc of the Dictionary class for more information of the format.
   It is likely that I will upgrade rmmseg's dictionary format to make
   those two compatible, writing a Ruby script to convert the dictionary
   is almost trivial.

 - Only complex algorithm is provided currently. And I don't see any need
   to implement the simple algorithm here if complex algorithm has a good
   performance and a much better accuracy.
